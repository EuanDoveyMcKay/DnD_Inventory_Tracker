The idea behind this project is that keeping track of DnD inventories is annoying for me when playing, because I have to keep track of everything seperately and/or in my head...

My character's inventory is in an app, but it is inconvinient to browse that inventory in the apps GUI, especially when I need to be looking at other stat blocks at the same time, the party's wagon inventory is dotted down on an A3 sheet
of paper, and I am not allowed to see the other character's inventorie, but would still know what kind of stuff they have from seeing them pick it up.

So, instead of keeping all of this info seperately (or looking for an already existing app to do it), I'll do the programmer thing of making my own inventory tracker system to do it!
The premise is quite simple: use object oriented programming (OOP) to create items with values, and to create inventories with characteristics, then asign them to each other and display on a GUI.
